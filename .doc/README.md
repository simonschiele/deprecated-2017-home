If you have nice snippets for me don't be shy! :-)

If you want to include awesome and vim config, you also should fetch subrepos:
    > git submodule init    
    > git submodule update

To add a new submodule to the repo, do something like this, from repo root dir:
    > git submodule add -f https://github.com/simonschiele/dot.vim.git .vim/

Beside the subrepos, these configs have other (optional) depends:
    * git_ps1 (for repoinfo in prompt, replaced soon with something thirdparty)
