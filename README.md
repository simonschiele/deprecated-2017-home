# deprecated-2017-home
> *Please be aware:* This repo was formerly named 'home.git' and reachable via
https://github.com/simonschiele/home/. I took the freedom to rename and start
over (breaking history/compatibility and therefore breaking repo 'home'). The
repo got so badly cluttered and I only moved around some local branches for a
few months. And as I see it, these kind of repos are public for picking, not to
clone and use. So hopefully no one ever relies on this anyway :-)

## Simons old dotfiles

bash stuff, scripts, Xsession-, ssh-client config, garbage...
